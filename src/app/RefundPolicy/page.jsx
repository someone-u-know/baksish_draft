            Subscription Refund Policy

          <p className="text-sm sm:text-base mb-4">
            We operate on a subscription-based model with a 3-month commitment period. Due to the nature of our services and the ongoing costs associated with maintaining and improving our system, we do not offer refunds on monthly subscriptions. However, if you encounter significant issues that cannot be resolved, we may consider a partial refund or credit towards future services on a case-by-case basis.
